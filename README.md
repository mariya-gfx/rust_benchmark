# Rust Benchmark Tests

Experimental features in Rust like `test` are not available on the stable release. Need to switch to the nightly release channel.

Install Rust nightly:

`rustup toolchain install nightly`

Set the default toolchain to nightly:

`rustup override set nightly`

Run tests:

`cargo test`

Run benchmark tests:

`cargo bench`
